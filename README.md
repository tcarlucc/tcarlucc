<p>
    Hey there! My name is Thomas Carlucci, I am currently studying for a B.S. in Computer Science
    at the University of Vermont. My primary experience with software development lies in Python, Java, and C++ but over the past few months I have been learning about various JavaScript frameworks like React and Next to build interactive web-apps.
